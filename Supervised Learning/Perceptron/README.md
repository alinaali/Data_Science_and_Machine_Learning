The perceptron is the building block of artificial neural networks, it is a simplified model of the biological neurons in our brain. A perceptron is the simplest neural network, one that is comprised of just one neuron. The perceptron algorithm was invented in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt.
Below is an illustration of a biological neuron:
